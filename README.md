  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>Stack Overflow is a popular platform where developers can ask and answer questions related to programming. This script utilizes web scraping techniques to extract valuable information from Stack Overflow's question pages, including question titles, vote counts, and tags.</p>
  <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
  <p>Before running the script, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>pandas</li>
    <li>requests</li>
    <li>BeautifulSoup (from bs4)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can install these libraries via pip:</p>
  <pre><code>pip install pandas requests beautifulsoup4</code></pre>
  <h2 id="scraping-all-questions">Scraping All Questions</h2>
  <p>The script starts by defining the URL for the desired tag (in this case, Python) and query filter (sorted by votes). It then sends a GET request to the URL and parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup. The script extracts information such as question titles, vote counts, and tags, printing them to the console.</p>
  <h2 id="scraping-only-needed-data">Scraping Only Needed Data</h2>
  <p>This section improves upon the previous one by structuring the extracted data into a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a question, containing the title, vote count, and tags. The script prints this structured data to the console.</p>
  <h2 id="changing-tags-and-scraping">Changing Tags and Scraping</h2>
  <p>Similar to the previous sections, this part of the script allows users to specify a different tag (e.g., JavaScript) and scrape questions related to that tag. The script follows the same process as before, printing the extracted data to the console.</p>
  <h2 id="scraping-multiple-pages">Scraping Multiple Pages</h2>
  <p>To scrape more questions beyond the first page, the script introduces a function <code>scrape_page()</code> that scrapes a single page of questions. It then iterates over multiple pages (specified by the <code>total_pages</code> variable) and prints the extracted data for each page.</p>
  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This script provides a basic framework for scraping Stack Overflow questions based on specific tags. Users can modify it according to their requirements, such as scraping additional details or handling pagination differently. Remember to use web scraping responsibly and adhere to Stack Overflow's terms of service.</p>
